# payload-jalali-date-picker

A simple integration of a **Jalali (Persian) date and time picker** as a custom component for **PayloadCMS**, built using **Next.js**, `react-multi-date-picker`, and `shadcn/ui`.

This project demonstrates how to extend PayloadCMS with custom fields to support Persian calendar-based date/time selection.
